/* Error report:
 *   Expand this comment:
 *   Explain the error(s) that occurred here, and then fix them
 Error: int n is in the scope of the first if statement, but it is not localized to the print statement on line 27
 To fix this error, I initialized n right after the scanner statement, and set it to a value of zero
 This will allow n to have a value, even if the compiler does not go through the if statement
